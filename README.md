# Java GUI Programming Collection

This project is a comprehensive collection of Java programs developed as part of the exercises from Chapter 13, "Advanced GUI," in *Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects* by Tony Gaddis. In addition to the core programming challenges from the chapter, numerous additional programs have been implemented, showcasing a wide range of JavaFX GUI concepts and techniques.

## Project Overview

The programs in this repository highlight various advanced GUI techniques, such as:

- Handling user input and real-time data updates
- Managing complex events and user interactions
- Displaying dynamic content based on user choices
- Integrating multiple JavaFX components, including `ComboBox`, `ListView`, `RadioButton`, `CheckBox`, `Button`, and `Label`
- Implementing calculations, data display, and other interactive functionalities in response to user input

Each program provides a unique learning opportunity to understand and apply advanced Java GUI design principles. This project is ideal for students, developers, or anyone looking to strengthen their skills in JavaFX.

## Key Programs

Here are some examples of the key programs included in the project:

1. **Dorm and Meal Plan Calculator**  
   Allows users to select a dormitory and meal plan, calculating the total cost based on user input.

2. **Skateboard Designer**  
   Provides options to customize a skateboard by selecting different components, including decks, wheels, and truck assemblies, and displays the total cost.

3. **Conference Registration System**  
   Enables users to register for a conference, choose optional events, and select workshops, calculating the registration fee dynamically.

4. **Smartphone Packages**  
   Allows users to select a data plan, choose a phone model, and add optional features, with real-time updates on monthly costs and taxes.

5. **Shopping Cart System**  
   A simplified online bookstore shopping cart where users can select books, view their cart, and check out with an itemized total and tax calculation.

## Additional Programs

In addition to the primary exercises, dozens of extra programs have been added, covering various aspects of GUI design and user interaction. These include:

- **Inventory Management Systems**: Simple applications that allow users to add, remove, and manage items in an inventory.
- **Finance Calculators**: Tools to calculate mortgage payments, loan amortization schedules, and other financial data.
- **Unit Converters**: Programs to convert measurements, currency, or other units interactively.
- **Game Interfaces**: Basic game setups to demonstrate interactive GUI elements and dynamic feedback.
- **Educational Tools**: Flashcards, quizzes, and other learning aids built with JavaFX components.

Each additional program provides a distinct use case for JavaFX and illustrates different ways to handle user interaction, data management, and dynamic updates within a GUI.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: JDK 8 or above is recommended.
- **JavaFX**: Ensure JavaFX is correctly configured in your IDE as it is the primary GUI framework for these applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run each program individually to explore different features and understand the various aspects of JavaFX GUI programming.

## How to Use This Collection

This project can serve as both a learning resource and a reference for developing interactive Java applications with JavaFX. You can:

- Experiment with different components and layouts to understand how they work.
- Study each program to learn how specific GUI elements and event handling are implemented.
- Use the programs as templates or starting points for your own GUI projects.

## Acknowledgments

This collection is based on exercises and concepts from *Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects* by Tony Gaddis, enhanced with additional projects to deepen understanding and provide hands-on experience in JavaFX.
